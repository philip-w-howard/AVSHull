 TODO:
	Rotation
		HullControl: m_dragging, etc. as properties. Setting one clears the others.
		Can go to m_IsRotating even if not editable
		Make sure rotation makes hull not editable.
		click off bulkhead deselects bulkhead
		rotate only works if no bulkhead is selected.
	
	Place pop-ups in center of parent. 
		See about box for sample
			<Window> WindowStartupLocation="CenterOwner"
			dlg.Owner = this;
		See CreateHullDialog as another example
			Set window (Left,Top) based on mouse position

		About (in center)
		CreateHull
		Open/Save/Import/Export
		Resize

	Check on notification settings.

	Check if Bulkhead(points, Type) is half hull or full hull.

	UI Standards:
		https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop/wpf/windows/dialog-boxes-overview?view=netdesktop-5.0
	Create hull from scratch
		Do something other than straight lines for bulkheads

	Split: use actual arcs instead of simulated ones.

	For Insert Bulkhead: compute location of click relative to drawing. Using m_xform, m_geometry.
		compute X,Y,Z is done
	
	Dialog appearance

	Data validation (beyond red rectangle)
	Rotate perspective with mouse.

	Save vs. SaveAs
		can use undoLog.Count to determine if there are unsaved changes?

	Panel Layout zoom
		relative to mouse

	Add version/Time to Hull. Done
	Add version/Time to Panel Layout
	Object/Property for displaying text in bottom notification panel.
	Compute X,Y,Z in panel display
	Get timestamp of panels in panel layout
		Compare with that of Hull

		Based on perspective?
		Tie to editableHull property?
		Enable/Disable context menu based on property value.
