Axis:
	X: left/right
	Y: Up/Down
	Z: along the keel

Hull
	contains vector of bulkheads
DisplayHull
	contains BaseHull
	vector of bulkheads
	vector of Chines
	Rotatable
	Editable
	Can return Geometry
HullControl
	Displays a DisplayHull

TODO:
	
	Place pop-ups in center of parent. 
		See about box for sample
			<Window> WindowStartupLocation="CenterOwner"
			dlg.Owner = this;
		See CreateHullDialog as another example
			Set window (Left,Top) based on mouse position

	Check on notification settings.

	Check if Bulkhead(points, Type) is half hull or full hull.

	UI Standards:
		https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop/wpf/windows/dialog-boxes-overview?view=netdesktop-5.0
	Create hull from scratch
		Do something other than straight lines for bulkheads

	Split: use actual arcs instead of simulated ones.

	For Insert Bulkhead: compute location of click relative to drawing. Using m_xform, m_geometry.
		compute X,Y,Z is done
	
	Dialog appearance
		PanelLayoutSettings
		gcode setup
	Dialog positioning
	Dialog data handling
	Settings
	Appearance based on styles
	Add bulkhead based on click
	Change number of chines UI
	Data validation (beyond red rectangle)
	Rotate perspective with mouse.

	Save vs. SaveAs
		can use undoLog.Count to determine if there are unsaved changes?

	X,Y,Z displayed (already calculated)
	Edit bulkhead dialog?

	Is PanelLayout separate app? Window? Tab?

	Panel Layout zoom
		relative to mouse

	Rethink use of BaseHull in EditableHull: Converted to singleton
	Merging tab layout changes
