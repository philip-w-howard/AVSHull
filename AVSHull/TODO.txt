TODO:
	
	Place pop-ups in center of parent. 
		See about box for sample
			<Window> WindowStartupLocation="CenterOwner"
			dlg.Owner = this;

	Create hull from scratch
		Do something other than straight lines for bulkheads

	Split: use actual arcs instead of simulated ones.

	For Insert Bulkhead: compute location of click relative to drawing. Using m_xform, m_geometry.
	
	Compute X,Y,Z relative to hull in PerspectiveView panel.

	Check on notification settings

	Make all changes to MyHull go through class to make it easy to do an "undo".
