	Create hull from scratch
		Do something other than straight lines for bulkheads

	Split: use actual arcs instead of simulated ones.

	For Insert Bulkhead: compute location of click relative to drawing. Using m_xform, m_geometry.
		compute X,Y,Z is done

	Panel Layout zoom
		relative to mouse

	Add version/Time to Hull.
	Object/Property for displaying text in bottom notification panel.
