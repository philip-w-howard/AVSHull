TODO:
	
	Place pop-ups in center of parent. 
		See about box for sample
			<Window> WindowStartupLocation="CenterOwner"
			dlg.Owner = this;
		See CreateHullDialog as another example
			Set window (Left,Top) based on mouse position

	UI Standards:
		https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop/wpf/windows/dialog-boxes-overview?view=netdesktop-5.0
	Create hull from scratch
		Do something other than straight lines for bulkheads

	Split: use actual arcs instead of simulated ones.

	For Insert Bulkhead: compute location of click relative to drawing. Using m_xform, m_geometry.
	
	Check on notification settings.

	Check if Bulkhead(points, Type) is half hull or full hull.
