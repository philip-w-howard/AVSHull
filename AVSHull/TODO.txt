Hull
	contains vector of bulkheads
DisplayHull
	contains BaseHull
	vector of bulkheads
	vector of Chines
	Rotatable
	Editable
	Can return Geometry
HullControl
	Displays a DisplayHull

TODO:
	
	Place pop-ups in center of parent. 
		See about box for sample
			<Window> WindowStartupLocation="CenterOwner"
			dlg.Owner = this;
		See CreateHullDialog as another example
			Set window (Left,Top) based on mouse position

	Check on notification settings.

	Check if Bulkhead(points, Type) is half hull or full hull.

	UI Standards:
		https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop/wpf/windows/dialog-boxes-overview?view=netdesktop-5.0
	Create hull from scratch
		Do something other than straight lines for bulkheads

	Split: use actual arcs instead of simulated ones.

	For Insert Bulkhead: compute location of click relative to drawing. Using m_xform, m_geometry.
		compute X,Y,Z is done
	
	Dialog appearance
		PanelLayoutSettings
		gcode setup
	Dialog positioning
	Dialog data handling
	Settings
	Appearance based on styles
	Add bulkhead based on click
	Change number of chines UI
	Data validation (beyond red rectangle)
	Rotate perspective with mouse.

	Save vs. SaveAs
		can use undoLog.Count to determine if there are unsaved changes?

	Edit bulkhead dialog?

	Is PanelLayout separate app? Window? Tab?

	Panel Layout zoom
		relative to mouse

	Add version/Time to Hull.
	Object/Property for displaying text in bottom notification panel.
	Compute X,Y,Z in panel display
	Get timestamp of panels in panel layout
		Compare with that of Hull

	Toolbar determined by tab selection
		slide-out details

	Refactor panel layout mess: MVVM
		panel: points for single panel
			shift, rotate, split
		PanelsLayoutSetup
			sheet size
			Sheet layout
			PanelLayoutSetup (window)
		PanelLayout
			Setup
			list of panels
		PanelLayoutControl
			Add visuals to Layout
		LayoutScroller
			ScrollViewer with a LayoutControl inside

		Get menus/toolbars working

		Check Notifications on panel hierarcy

	Undo/Redo is broken. I think Bulkhead updates are re-entering undo list
	Add Undo/Redo to Layout
	Pass undo/redo to appropriate tab
		Create/Implement IUndoable interface
	Have Load/Save pass to current tab

	Move Tools to toolbar inside tab
	Implement tool slide-out: Expander
